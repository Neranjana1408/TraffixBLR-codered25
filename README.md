Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication System

Overview

This project demonstrates a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication System using real-time data sharing between vehicles to improve road safety, optimize traffic flow, and enhance incident response.
The system leverages GPS modules and nRF24L01 RF communication to enable:
Real-Time Data Sharing: Exchange of vehicle location and speed information to avoid collisions,
Hazard Alerts: Immediate notifications about road conditions, accidents, or emergency vehicles to improve situational awareness,
Traffic Optimization: Sharing live data to reroute vehicles, reduce congestion, and save fuel,
This system is implemented with two vehicles: Fast Car and Receiver Car.

The features of this project are:
1. Real-Time Dual-Parameter Monitoring
Speed and Distance Integration: Combines GPS-based speed monitoring and NRF-based distance calculation for accurate safety assessments.
High-Speed Scenarios: Improves accuracy over traditional distance-only systems.
2. Long-Range Communication
NRF24L01 Wireless Module: Provides reliable, long-range communication compared to ultrasonic or infrared sensors.
Preemptive Alerts: Vehicles can react to hazards even before visual or physical contact.
3. Flexible and Scalable Design
Versatile Environments: Works in urban, rural, and highway scenarios where line-of-sight systems fail.
Modular Hardware: The system is easy to upgrade with additional sensors (e.g., accelerometers, cameras).
4. Cost-Effective and DIY-Friendly
Affordable Components: Built with Arduino, GPS, and NRF24L01 modules.
Accessible Prototyping: Ideal for educational purposes and low-budget implementations.
5. Enhanced Safety
Proactive Alerts: Prevents collisions by measuring speed and distance for early warnings.
Emergency Support: Alerts vehicles to move aside for ambulances or police vehicles.
6. Reliable Communication
2.4 GHz NRF24L01 Module: Ensures robust data exchange with minimal interference.
7. Environment-Friendly
Supports integration with electric and autonomous vehicles for green transportation.
